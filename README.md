# LEADR10 Built Heritage Challenge

<p>This repository is dedicated to the 10-year anniversary challenge on UNESCO heritage sites. 3D printing or “additive manufacturing” has fast become an important method of research visualization. Here in LEADR, we have 3 different types of 3D printers (MakerBot Z18, Ultimaker Extended 2+ and PRUSA mini) and a total of 4 printers in the main lab space. Historians and Anthropologists have manufactured visual representations of their research whether that be a 3D terrain map representing a specific area, a historical object, or heritage buildings and objects to create effective arguments that explain phenomena.</p>

## Challenge:
<p></p>Your task as part of LEADR10 is to build and 3D print a UNESCO World Heritage site. Using SketchUp and any of the 3D printers in the lab, we challenge you to create a 3D model of one of the sites in this list: https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/ .</p>
